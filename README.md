Description: This is a simple Javascript powered game that automatically guesses a letter that the user attempts to guess. 

    - If the user guesses the correct letter they win and then automatically start a new game      where they have 10 more chances to win.
    - If the user doesn't guess the correct letter after 10 guesses they lose and then             automatically start a new game. 
        -If the user guesses the same letter on accident, they'll be  alerted that they've            guessed the same letter and given another opportunity to guess another  letter.
